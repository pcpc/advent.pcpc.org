Of the increase of His government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over His kingdom, to establish it and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.”"

The gloom was real. Zebulon and Naphtali were the first regions of Galilee to fall to Assyria in 733 BC (9:1). But the distress, though real, was not the final nor the fundamental reality. Those first in darkness would be first to see the dawn of the new day of grace (v. 2). The first to weep would be first to rejoice. The first to be cast from God’s presence would be the first redeemed, reconciled, restored (v. 3).

The God who delivered His people from Egypt and the Midianites (vv. 4,5), would free the believing remnant from the gloom of His wrath (Ex. 6:6-7): they would be restored to favor with God.

But, how does God accomplish this? Isaiah declares that a King shall come, born of human parentage but given by the Lord (v 6), a perfect King, eminently qualified to accomplish His task: a “wonder of a counselor” possessing supernatural wisdom, who conquers and governs in the power of God, a faithful Father who brings everlasting care and comfort, a Prince, at one with God and with His people, who makes wounded souls whole in the peace of God (vv. 6-7).

At His advent, the coming King will zealously fulfill His calling to gather and finally bring to glory all those whom the Father gave to Him in eternity (v. 7b; John 17:1ff). This will happen. Count on it. It is guaranteed, because the Lord who plans our future (v. 1) and shatters our foes (v. 5) also keeps His promises (v. 7).

And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‘Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.’”"

But hear the words of God when He says, “It is He who will save His people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21). This baby Jesus is a unique child, for He is the Savior of His people.

No doctor is able to foretell the future of a child’s spiritual life, yet the Scriptures tell us Jesus’ future—He came to save His people. This baby boy has been sent of God the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary in order to deliver His people from their sin. The Apostle Paul tells us, “The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 6:23).

No one can save himself from death, for we are all sinners and will surely die. Our salvation must come from outside of ourselves. God must act on our behalf. And God Himself did act on our behalf when He conceived the baby boy Jesus, that Jesus would come to earth and live a perfectly righteous life and to die a substitutionary death. Mary bore a son and Jesus bore our sin.

Worship the One who took away your sin.

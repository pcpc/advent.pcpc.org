I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in Him in all speech and all knowledge—even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you—so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”"

The Holy Spirit tells us otherwise in this passage from 1 Corinthians. Through the words of the apostle Paul we understand that God’s spiritual gifts have a necessary connection to our waiting for “the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ” (v. 7). In other words, the grace of God is not given in order that we might hoard our gifts for own enjoyment, but so that we might be adequately equipped to live as those who anticipate the great coming of our Savior. The very promises that he will “sustain” us (v. 8), that indeed “God… is faithful” (v. 9), are intended to make our hope certain and our confidence sure. And the gifts that God has given us are to be used to declare the praises of the God who called us and to proclaim to all the world the coming of that One whom we anticipate. And so we meditate during Advent upon the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. His first coming, in a state of lowliness and humiliation, guarantees His second coming, in a state of glory and exaltation. And on this day we fix our hope, even as we stand “enriched” in Christ to do His will until He comes.

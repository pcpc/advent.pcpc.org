David says, “The Lord is my light.” Why is David confident of this? Light brings understanding and enables us to see. Psalm 18:28 says, “For it is You who light my lamp; the Lord God lightens my darkness.” David knows that God will bring him understanding to move through whatever darkness he will face. God’s light reveals who He is so we can see Him and have fellowship with Him (1 John 5:5-7).

Secondly, David knows God is his salvation. David has seen God deliver him from his enemies and he is confident that God will continue to do so. Salvation is God’s work and we can rest in it.

Thirdly, David is confident because God is his stronghold. A stronghold is a place of security. God is David’s security.

Because God is all of these things to David, he confidently asserts, “Of whom shall I fear?” When evildoers, adversaries, foes and even a whole army come against him, he says, “My heart shall not fear, though war arises against me, yet will I be confident.”

Where does David derive this confidence? David’s central focus in life was to seek after the Lord, to be where He is, and to enjoy His beauty. David finds confidence in the worship of his living, protecting God, who reveals Himself by His light.

At Christmas, as we adorn our home with lights, let us remember that it is God who brings His light to adorn our hearts so we can know Him. His light will draw us into His fellowship and drive out all darkness and fear.

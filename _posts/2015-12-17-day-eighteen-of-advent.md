  reference: "John 3:16-21"
  text: "“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God.”"

Crafted in God’s image, our gift-giving rituals are a pale and often distorted reflection of the Gift-Giver Himself. God is the supreme giver of gifts. His Son, Jesus Christ, is the gift. But what compelled God to give us His only Son? Was it His duty and drudgery or desire?

Unlike a battery-operated doll that repeats the same three phrases when squeezed, the gift of God provides commentary on why and for what reason God gave Him as a gift to the world. In the dark of the night, Jesus explains to Nicodemus the reason for the season.

Let us pause and mediate on this gospel truth: It was God’s love that from all eternity compelled the Incarnation of His Son into a world that would hate and murder Him.

Sadly, as familiarity breeds contempt, the words of John 3:16 often fall on deaf ears. In our crowded and distracted lives we have grown numb to the wonder of God’s gift for us in Christ.

Here it is again: in the gift of Jesus Christ God loves the unlovely. God loves those who hate Him. God loves those in darkness. God sent his Beloved into the world this time not to condemn us in our darkness but to liberate us into the light. In Christ God desires to give us the gift of Himself.

Thus, it stands to reason that the greatest gift of all is Jesus Christ. Through faith in Christ God opens up to us, like a set of Russian nesting dolls, the mysterious and hidden treasures of His eternal life and love.

Though man in his wickedness despises the love of God, having sought even to destroy it, the Gift remains given to all those who would receive it by faith.

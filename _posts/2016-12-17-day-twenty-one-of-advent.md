  text: "“In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee... the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, ‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”"

  text: " O God of my deliverance, You are strong to save. It is Your right hand that has delivered Your people from sin. I confess that my heart is a wilderness of evil. Come make my rough ways smooth. Help me to prepare for Your coming by granting me a heart of true repentance. Thank You that You have written me into Your history book by including me in the salvation that Christ brings. May these truths be present to my heart and mind this season in particular as I reflect on Your coming. Amen."

Imagine that you are a sixth century B.C. Jew in exile. You have never known anything but captivity. From childhood you have been told the Exodus stories, but all of your life your lot has been to wander in the wilderness. Suddenly, a voice is crying in that wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord! Make straight in the desert a highway for our God! Could it be? Is that God coming to lead us home? To deliver us from this exile? God is saying, Comfort, comfort. Jerusalem’s warfare is ended, and her iniquity is pardoned. Salvation is at hand!

Luke remembers these words from Israel’s history to say that this scene is being re-enacted in a new desert. John the Baptizer has become the voice crying in the wilderness. And Yahweh is coming to lead His people still to an even more glorious redemption. He has come, in the flesh, to make the rough places plain.

The history is still being told, for it is to the wilderness of our hearts that Christ comes, and it is there that we must prepare for His coming. He has come to level the mountains of our pride, to fill up the valleys of our fear. He has come to smooth out the rough places of our waywardness, our lack of love, our hurtful words. He has come to make the crooked roads of our perverse ways straight. Comfort, comfort, O people! See the salvation of God! Prepare His way and rejoice in your deliverance.

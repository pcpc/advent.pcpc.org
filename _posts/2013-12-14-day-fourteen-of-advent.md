  text: "“As you come to Him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: ‘Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.’ So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,’ and ‘A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense...’ But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”"

Not only was the Temple central to the Jewish worldview, so also was their ethnic identity as the nation of Israel. But notice that Peter says that the “living stones,” (the church, which is built upon Jesus), are not only the true Temple but are also the true Israel, the true people of God. He says, “You are the chosen race, you are a royal priesthood, you are a holy nation, you are a people for God’s own possession.”

Through Jesus and in Jesus a whole new community is being built, and it isn’t being built based on race or status or privilege. Instead, it is being built on the basis of one’s trust in Jesus and His life, death, and resurrection. This is what our world needs to hear this Advent season. It needs to hear that all the other “communities,” whatever they may be, are mere parodies of this one true community that is founded on Jesus Christ, and it is the community where the living God makes His home.

How will they hear this message if we, the community of Jesus, the Temple of the Living God, are not proclaiming His excellencies in word and deed to the world?

The apostle John incorporates this dual understanding of God’s Word into his portrayal of Jesus. On the one hand, Jesus is the living extension of God Himself, “The Word was God.” On the other, Jesus is distinct from God, having a life of His own, “The Word was with God.” Echoing Genesis 1, John tells us twice that the Word was “in the beginning” as the present and active agent of God in the creation of the world. He goes on to explain that the Word was both the life and light of the original creation.

But now something new is happening. The same light that pierced the darkness of the old creation is bringing to light a new creation. Just as the darkness did not prevail in the beginning, likewise, it will not prevail now. God’s creative Word is active again to bring light and life, but not in the way most people would have expected. It is neither the Jewish Torah as understood by the Pharisees, nor the hidden principle of rationality as understood by the pagan philosophers. It is the living embodiment of God’s authoritative Word, his life-giving Torah, His creative Wisdom in the person of Jesus. And He will make all things new.

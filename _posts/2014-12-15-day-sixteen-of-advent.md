  text: "“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”"

> God of creation (“Let light”) made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

The gospel displays the light of the new creation by showing how Jesus Christ manifests the glory of God’s image. The holy and merciful character of God is fully represented in Jesus Christ. The umbilical corded, blood covered and placenta smeared baby Jesus is the precise expression of the unseen God. Jesus is the visible, material manifestation of the immortal, invisible God. He is the embodiment of God’s own substance. As the creed says of Jesus, He is God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God.

Adam was created in God’s image. That is, he was created to be God’s representative on earth but fell from it and was barred from God’s presence. Jesus Christ is the full and final revelation of God’s presence to all of us who belong to Adam (Heb 1:2). Therefore, the fullness of deity dwelt in a feeding trough that those who had refused to recognize Him in His superintendence over all might come to recognize Him. The sum of all divine excellence is seen in the face of Christ. To see His glory is to be saved, for we are transformed by seeing God in Christ (2 Cor 3:18).

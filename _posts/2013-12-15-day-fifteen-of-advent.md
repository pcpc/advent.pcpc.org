For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over His kingdom, to establish it and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.”"

Readers of the Old Testament know all too well that Israel did not fulfill its mandate. But God had purposed to make His light to shine most brilliantly in the depths of His own humiliation. And so the glorious picture of Isaiah 60:1-3 comes to pass not in a righteous nation but in a tiny infant in whom all the hopes of Israel found their fulfillment.

God first called a few wandering shepherds to “arise” when His glory shone about them and His messenger told them good tidings of great joy. God also assured that “kings [would come] to the brightness of your rising,” sending Magi from the east to “arise” and follow a singular star to the humility of Bethlehem.

And finally, God fulfilled His promise that “nations shall come to your light,” drawing people from many tribes and tongues to a Jewish Savior, killed in humiliation but raised in glory. This is the wonder we celebrate during Advent; the light of God in Jesus Christ has shone upon us, and that light will return one day with even greater brilliance. On that day the glory of the Lord will be fully displayed, and we will never again walk in darkness.

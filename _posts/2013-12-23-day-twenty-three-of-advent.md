Christ gives us victory because He takes away the judgments against us. Our sins bring death and the wrath of God, but Christ Jesus removes those judgments, making our case legally clear before God (Rom. 3:21-23). Still, the devil prowls around looking for men to devour. Yet, we can rejoice because Christ’s death on the cross disarmed the devil’s power and triumphed over him (Col. 2:15). Because Christ dwells in our midst, we need never fear evil again.

Christ’s victory brings us joy. We rejoice because our King is in our midst and continues to bring us the fruits of our salvation. He, too, rejoices with us because we are His and He delights in us. His love is so large and so personal that our hearts are overwhelmed with peace. This peace truly leads our hearts to say, “Joy to the World!”
